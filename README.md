Table Tennis (also known as Ping Pong) has been a popular game over a hundred years. The aim of the game is to try to hit a small ball back and forth across the table, with a player scoring a point if their opponent fails to return it.

Table Tennis has always been a popular idea for a computer game, with <em>Tennis for Two</em> being developed as early as 1958. The first commercially successful video game version was called <em>Pong</em>, after Ping Pong, and was developed by <em>Atari</em> in the early 1970s. It became hugely popular in arcades and Atari quickly became a household name. The game is widely believed to have kickstarted the gaming industry, which today is worth billions of pounds.

The original game had simple <em>two-dimensional graphics</em>. The player was able to move the bat, or <em>paddle</em>, up and down the left-hand side of the screen. The paddle on the right-hand side was either controlled by the computer or another player. With the paddles, the players hit the ball back and forth, trying to guess the angle where the ball will bounce next. Points are scored if a player cant return a shot. In the original arcade game, the player controlled the paddle by turning a knob.

Pong was so popular many other game manufacturers tried to imitate it. Other versions were also developed, such as <em>Home Pong</em>, which you could play using a simple <em>console</em> and a television screen. Home Pong lead to the rise of home video game consoles as we know them today. In 2012, Atari celebrated Pongs 40th anniversary by releasing an app so players could play on smartphones or tablets.
